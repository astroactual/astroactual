### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me : 

My name is Matthew and I am a student in the GIT Full Stack Web Development program at ASU. I have some coding experience in minor projects throughout the years, as well as a few coding classes already under my belt. I hope to land a development/engineering job after this program, and hope to further my career and provide for my family.  

I love coding because I love computers, problem solving, and creating. I feel Full Stack development is all of those things in one, and I can really scratch all of the itches in my brain at once with this program  

I love hanging out with my daughter and wife, playing video games, watching movies/tv/anime, and reading!
